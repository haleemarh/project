        <h5>Dr. Elizabeth Hoge, assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, says mindfulness meditation is perfect for reducing anxiety both short- and long-term: 

"People with anxiety have a problem dealing with distracting thoughts that have too much power ... You might think 'I'm late, I might lose my job if I don't get there on time, and it will be a disaster!' Mindfulness teaches you to recognize, 'Oh, there's that thought again. I've been here before. But it's just that--a thought, and not a part of my core self.'"

Research shows you only need 10-15 minutes of meditation per day to get the health benefits, which includes reducing stress hormone levels, increasing serotonin, and strengthening your ability to let go of thoughts that don't serve you. Download a meditation app like Calm or Headspace to get started..</h5>

        <p class="card-text">Multitasking is generally bad for anxiety, but if you're going to do it, get yourself some Juicy Fruit.

A study out of Swinburne University found that people who chew gum while multitasking under stress had lower cortisol levels, reduced levels of stress and anxiety, and increased levels of alertness and performance.

Another found that chewing gum can improve a negative mood, and increase levels of peace and calm. Scientists don't know precisely why, but believe it's because chewing gum tends to improve blood flow in the brain.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">GET ENOUGH SLEEP</h5>
        <p class="card-text">If you take nothing else away from this, hear this: If you're prone to anxiety, it's critical that you get enough sleep.

According to neuroscientists out of UC Berkeley, when you don't get enough sleep, your brain's amygdala and insular cortex both light up in a pattern similar to the abnormal neural activity of people with anxiety disorders.

Senior study author Matthew Walker says, "These findings help us realize that those people who are anxious by nature are the same people who will suffer the greatest harm from sleep deprivation."

In other words, if you're anxious, you're far more likely to develop a full-on anxiety disorder if you don't get enough sleep regularly. It's vital that your brain gets the rest you need.

        <h5 class="card-title">CHECK YOUR PHONE LESS</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Research out of University of British Columbia took 124 study participants and had one group limit how often they checked their email (to three times a day only). The other group could check as often as they wanted.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, researchers found that people were less stressed when they checked their email less frequently.

The key here is to limit how often you're doing it. It's not about neglecting your duties, but about not jumping every time you see an email notification pop up on your phone.

Consider taking all that time you're saving by not checking your email to meditate, journal, take a forest bath, and/or watch a funny video.

You'll be the most relaxed person in the office in no time .</p>
