        <h5>Many studies prove that prayer lessens the feeling of anxiety and depression and the whenever the prophet PBUH felt anxious or sad,he would rush to prayer.<br><br>Allah gifted us the five daily prayers right after ta'if which is the saddest time in the prophet's life.Salah is one of the most powerful tool for fighting mental health issues.One of the most beautiful things about being a muslim is knowig you're never alone,that you always have Allah,that he hears your dua's and cries,that he would never burden you with more than you can endure and that no matter how much sins you've committed,do not despair for he is the most merciful and he would forgive you.Start praying your five daily prayers on time today and by Allah's will your mental health will be restored<br>When we offer salah, it’s actually a confession we are making that we alone can’t resolve our problems, because we are weak, fragile and easily broken. You are resting your faith on a Higher Power that’s Constant, Timeless and Divine when performing salah. This submission leads to healing a distressed heart.</h5>

        <p class="card-text">Reconnecting with Allah is always a good way to relieve stress. Read the Qur’an and take solace from Allah’s wise words.

Take a few minutes out of your day to read the Qur’an, however much you can. Start off slowly and read a few lines of the Arabic or the translation if you’re not used to it. There are many Qur’an apps with translation. If reading the actual Qur’an seems heavy for you, start on a app. Make it a habit to read at least one ayah a day if not more..</p>

        <h5>Journaling is proven by research to bring several health benefits in addition to stress relief. This is a highly recommended stress reliever. Keep a gratitude journal to help you remember all the things that are good in your life.

Regularly writing down your thoughts can help you clear your mind. Whether it’s writing down things you are grateful for or just organizing thoughts that have been bothering you can relax your mind. It helps clarify your sources of stress for you and redirects you to a healthier state of mind. When you start feeling stressed, spend a few minutes looking through your notes to remind yourself what really matters<br>Don’t worry about what to write. Just write what you want. Write freely about events and people that affect your everyday life. Remember, no one is going to see your writing. This is for you.</h5>

        <h5>There is no form of relaxation and fun more rewarding in both the worlds than that of spending time with one’s family. The Prophet’s encouragement of this can be found in many hadiths mentioning that he played, joked and raced with his wives. They would tell him stories, and he would play with the children and make them laugh. The Prophet (peace be upon him) was a role model as a family man. Indeed, it would take an entire book to discuss the Prophet (peace be upon him) as a role model within the family</h5>

		<h1>APPRECIATING NATURE</h1>

		<h5>Even if it’s just taking a walk in the park or standing in your backyard for a few minutes, reconnecting with nature is therapeutic. Find a scenic place around your neighborhood or town, and go hiking as a family or have a picnic lunch in your backyard to recharge.

We spend so much time inside or using technology, whether it be our laptop, phones, social media or watching Netflix shows, that we don’t get enough vitamin D we would naturally get from the sun. So taking a small part of your day to step outside can be very healing.Sometimes the beauty outweighs the pain.From the little kids we see playing on the street,the akara woman,the life of your sisters kid,the smell of sand after rain,everything is so beautiful,all you have to do is look.

Yes, we are time pressed. But you must take out little time everyday for your health and well-being, as they are blessings from Allah.</h5>
